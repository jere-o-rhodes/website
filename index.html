                                <p class="card-text"> In theory, tenants have the right to live in "habitable" conditions. Across New Mexico, thousands of tenants live in units riddled with everything from bed bugs and roach infestations to a lack of hot water. Often, when they reach out to landlords, officials and governmental bodies, they are ignored and their issues go unaddressed. I inspected hundreds of thousands of 311 records and talked with dozens of tenants and advocates for this story that I wrote for my internship with Searchlight New Mexico. </p>

She received this honor even as the state experiences record toxic oil spills, controversial alternative energy plans and a reliance on oil and gas for 1/3 of its budget. For my internship with Searchlight New Mexico, I wrote about her appointment and the opinions of New Mexico's climate advocates. </p>
